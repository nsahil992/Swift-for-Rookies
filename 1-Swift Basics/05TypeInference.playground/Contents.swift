// When you create a variable and give it a value without specifying the type then swift automatically set it for you.

let role = "iOS Developer"
// Swift has automatically set the value to type String

var age = 21
// Swift has automatically set the value to type Int

var isCoding = true
// Swift has automatically set the value to type Bool

// There maybe some cases where you need to explicitly define the type which is know as Type Annotations

let Role: String = "iOS Engineer"
let Age: Int = 21
let iSCoding: Bool = true

// However it is perfectly fine to use either of the two.
